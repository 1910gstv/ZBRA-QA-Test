1.Explain the importance of quality assurance in a project.
	
The quality assurance is important because it can prevent bugs, errors and failures in the final product to be delivered for a final user. It also guarantees all expected functions defined by a client, with a lower cost and extract the maximum of the software.


2.In 8 hours, 20 trucks can unload 160 m³ of sand into a pit. In 5 hours, how many trucks are necessary to unload 125 m³ of sand?

This could be calculated in this way: if less hours, more trucks, even if are less sand.
20 = 5 * 160  => 20 = 800
x      8    125        x    1000

800x = 20 * 1000
800x = 20000
x = 20000 / 800 => x = 25

So, 25 trucks are necessary to unload 125m³ of sand in 5 hours.

3.Given the toy below, describe test scenarios that guarantee that its functionalities are properly implemented

The first scenario, we must put  sand behind the truck and check if the sand doesn't fall over the truck.
The second scenario, we must if the pieces enter into the correct forms.
The Third scenario, we must guarantee if the pieces won’t be entered into different forms.
The fourth scenario, we must test with all the wheels are enabled and the truck can go to the floor.
